2A. Developer Nirvana?
  - No data access :)
  - (do a little demo of what I mean)

3. A short history of Data Access on .NET
  - Datasets, why it's bad programming practice to bind a Dataset directly to your UI.
    - Prevents you from building a clean model of your business domain
  - Domain Model (Active Record etc) with hand coded DAL
    - Takes a huge effort to create, can be over 50% of your effort.
  - Code Generation (Code Smith templates etc)
    - also seen DSL tools used. 
    - Personally seen many examples.
    
4. Object Relational Mapping tools
  - Dynamically manage persistence concerns at runtime.
